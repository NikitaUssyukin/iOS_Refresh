//If you need a collection of values that can contain duplicates, or the order of your items matters, you should use an array
//Arrays store items in the order you add them, and you access them using numerical positions

//Tuples
//If you need a specific, fixed collection of related values where each item has a precise position or name, you should use a tuple
//Tuples are fixed in size, and you can attach names to each of their items. You can read items using numerical positions or using your names of the items
